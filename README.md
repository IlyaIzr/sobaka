Summary:
An app for creative writing, no-confirmation sign-up, unlogged mode, and a special Crazy mode for inspiration. So far russian version only. React-redux, Firebase and Bootstrap 4 

Description:
I made a dark-themed nice looking app for my friends. It's like another one sticky notes app, but this time it has a speccial mode.
At first I called this mode Crazy, as I wanted to allow writer to be distracted by other thoughts floating on window.
Many people  when it comes to creative writing gets paralyzed by this blank sheet. This time it's dark and it doesn't have to be empty, although
you would do the whole writing job.

You can create an account by any email with no confirmation, collect and delete your notes. You can write first moment after
getting on site with no registration, data will save on browser local storage.

Future updates:
+english version
+light theme

Well, i think that's it
